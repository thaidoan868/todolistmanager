!To DO LIST MANAGER DOCUMENTAION!
This program is used to manage daily tasks using priority queue, heap, queue data structures 
You can add new tasks, extract highest priority tasks after finishing, display waiting tasks, and much more.
We use first-in-first-out machanism to handle tasks with the same priority.
The application provides command-line user interface to hide complicated operations. This program can easly be done by implemening the link list data structure but we prefer hard ways.
Enjoy your work!
